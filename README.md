Mental Health 
Mental health encompasses our emotional, psychological, and social well-being, influencing our thoughts, feelings, actions, stress management, relationships, and decision-making throughout life.
Mental health is vital for overall well-being, as it impacts physical health and vice versa. Depression, for instance, heightens the risk of chronic physical ailments like diabetes and heart disease, while enduring physical conditions can raise the likelihood of mental health issues.
